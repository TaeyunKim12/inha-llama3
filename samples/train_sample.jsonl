{"output": "findings_TYPE_1 : The patient has an ulcerative lesion located in the distal antrum of the stomach. The maximum thickness of the lesion is measured to be 3.2 cm, and its maximum length is 3.5 cm. This lesion has been classified as T1b, indicating that the tumor has invaded the submucosal layer of the stomach wall.\n\nThe diagnosis includes N2 staging, signifying metastasis to 3-6 regional lymph nodes. Specifically, there is involvement of lymph nodes in the left gastric, left paracardial, celiac artery, hepatoduodenal ligament, and portal areas. \n\nAdditionally, the presence of distant metastases (M1 stage) has been identified. Lymph nodes related to this stage include peripancreatic, retroperitoneal, and pancreaticoduodenal nodes.\n\nOverall, the disease is staged at IVB, which indicates advanced disease with both regional and distant metastases, implicating a more guarded prognosis and requiring comprehensive management and treatment strategies.,", "input": "Ulcerative\nDistal antrum\nMaximum Thichness: 3.2cm\nMaximum Length: 3.5cm\nT1b: Tumor invades submucosa\nN2: Metastasis in 3-6 regional lymph nodes\nN stage LN: Left gastric, Left Paracardial, Celiac a., Hepatoduodenal, portal\nM1: Distant metastasis\nM stage LN metastasis: Peripancreatic, Retroperitoneal, Pancreaticoduodenal\nIVB\n", "instruction": "Please convert it according to the following format when you receive content that briefly summarizes the results diagnosed by a doctor.\n\nFindings : \nUlcerative\nDistal antrum\nMaximum Thichness: 3.2cm\nMaximum Length: 3.5cm\nT1b: Tumor invades submucosa\nN2: Metastasis in 3-6 regional lymph nodes\nN stage LN: Left gastric, Left Paracardial, Celiac a., Hepatoduodenal, portal\nM1: Distant metastasis\nM stage LN metastasis: Peripancreatic, Retroperitoneal, Pancreaticoduodenal\nIVB\n\nfindings_TYPE_1 : \nThe patient has an ulcerative lesion located in the distal antrum of the stomach.
